// n is an Integer denoting the NUMBER of TOWERS
// m is an Interger denoting the HEIGHT of EACH tower

// Players can reduce their tower height of x by y. And y must evenly divide into x.
// Remove a number greater than 1 but less than x. Ok to use 1 if your tower height is 2
// When the tower is evenly divided by height: newTowerHeight = towerHeight - y;

// 2 Players. Player 1 always goes first

  // Player 2 Turn
  // Repeat turns until game ends

  // Return 1 if Player 1 wins, or 2 if Player 2 wins
